# advanced-medical-recommendation-gnn-llm
The goal of this project is to develop an advanced medical prediction system that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs) to generate accurate and detailed predictions based on a graph-structured biomedical database

The system will leverage NeDRex, an interactive biomedical discovery platform designed to identify disease modules and enable drug repurposing. This database captures complex and multiscale relationships between genes, proteins, diseases, and drugs, providing a robust foundation for training graph-based models enriched with contextual information. The proposed architecture will combine graph embeddings with semantic information extracted through LLMs applied to associated textual data. This hybrid approach aims to harness the reasoning and contextualization capabilities of LLMs while preserving the topological structure of the biomedical networks, ultimately enhancing the system’s inference and predictive performance. System validation will involve a comprehensive evaluation using precision and performance metrics, assessing the model’s ability to reliably recommend pharmacological treatments and to surpass existing predictive methods in the clinical domain. Upon completion, the system is expected to identify effective treatments for specific diseases, offering a powerful tool for personalized medicine and paving the way for future research and continuous improvements.

This project has been realized for the final thesis of the master in telecommunication engineering.
